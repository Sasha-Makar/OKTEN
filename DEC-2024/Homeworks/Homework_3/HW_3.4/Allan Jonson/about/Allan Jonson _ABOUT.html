            My name is Allan Johnson, and I am a personal coach. My goal is to assist people identify and overcome
            obstacles in their lives and to maximize their potential. Through my coaching, I help people set goals,
            build the confidence and skills they need to achieve success and develop a positive mindset and a sense of
            self-worth.

            As the famous American author, salesman and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar once said: â€œSuccess is the
            doing, not the getting; in the trying, not the triumph. Success is a personal standard, reaching for the
            highest that is in us, becoming all that we can be. If we do our best, we are a success.
